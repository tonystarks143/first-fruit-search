## Code Explanation

The `App.js` file contains the main React component for the app. This component renders a list of fruits, and it also provides a search bar where users can enter the name of a fruit. When a user enters a search term, the component uses the [fruits API](https://fruits.jsonbin.io/) to fetch a list of fruits that match the search term. The component then renders the fruits in the list.

The `Fruit.js` file contains the React component for a single fruit. This component renders the fruit's name, image, and description.

The `index.js` file is the entry point for the app. This file imports the `App` component and renders it to the DOM.

The `.env` file contains the environment variables for the app. These variables include the API key for the fruits API.

The `package.json` file contains the dependencies for the app. These dependencies include React, ReactDOM, and the fruits API.

The `scripts` object in the `package.json` file contains the scripts that are used to start, build, test, and eject the app.

The `eslintConfig` object in the `package.json` file contains the configuration for ESLint. ESLint is a tool that helps you to write better code.

The `browserslist` object in the `package.json` file contains the browsers that the app is compatible with. This information is used by the build process to create a production build of the app that is optimized for the target browsers.
